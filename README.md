Operation (Unity Game)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A modern 3D recreation of the classic board game Operation, built in Unity. The game focuses on precision physics gameplay, time-based scoring, and player accuracy using tweezers to extract objects without triggering mistakes.

Overview

This project recreates Operation as a 3D desktop game using Unity. Players control tweezers to carefully remove objects from a patient while managing time, mistakes, and a dynamic Blood-loss Meter. The goal is to remove all objects as quickly and accurately as possible before blood loss reaches zero.
